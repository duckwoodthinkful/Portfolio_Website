            <p>
              I live in Pennsylvania and I make laboratory equipment for use in
              electrochemistry. Electrochemistry covers all kinds of interesting
              topics, including batteries, corrosion, and solar cells. I bet you
              are using something every day that deals with electrochemistry!

              I attend Penn State University for both my undergraduate and
              graduate degrees in <em>Engineering Science and Mechanics</em>. I
              have been working for over 25 years in the field of
              electrochemistry. I have been writing code since I had my first
              computer, a CP/M based

            </p>
            <p>
              I have worked with many technologies over the years.  I can offer services in html, javascript, C/C++, C#, and LabView.
              I have also worked on developing and signing Windows device drivers.  I love working with teams of people because together we can develop great things!
